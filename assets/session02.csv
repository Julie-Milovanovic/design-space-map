B,"I guess, do we decide what a personal--I mean personal assistant",S,1
B,and entertainment system don't necessarily mean--,S,1
A,Go together?,Bs,1
B,--for me unless it's personal assistant,S,1
B,"to make sure that I've watched the TV shows,",Bs,2
B,but it's like the Alexa.,F,1
A,"So right now, we have, I call it the POS4, it's actually the PS4,",S,1
A,"but because it is so hard to use and I'm not a gamer, so right away,",Bs,1
A,the control,S,2
A,that it comes with is,Bs,2
A,a gaming console.,S,3
A,"I mean, it took months to even get to the point where I could, like, watch TV. It's so complicated.",Bs,1
A,"And then I've got, like, state of the art TV,",S,3
A,"I got state of the art, you know, receiver amplifier,",S,3
A,and then state of the art this POS4 thing.,S,1
A,"So they all, you know, are connected together,",Bs,1
A,"So, anyway, this is something that's pretty dear to my heart. I want it to be easy to use.",F,1
B,Anybody used like Alexa,S,1
B,"or any of Google's, like,",S,1
B,integrated systems? I haven't.,F,1
B,Were you just supposed to talk to it,F,1
B,"and play TV,",F,3
B,"get your shopping list, all that kind of stuff?",F,3
C,feed the cat.,F,3
C,So that's a chore.,Bs,3
C,"Lock door,",F,3
C,"control lights,",F,3
C,identify guests.,F,3
B,So we want a POS4,S,1
B,that you could talk to and just ask everything.,Be,1
A,That's right. I want to be able to talk to it.,Be,1
A,"And I actually, admittedly, not tried to use Alexa. We have Alexa,",S,1
C,But that would--you'd have to be able to hook it up through that,Be,1
C,so that it could do stuff.,Bs,1
A,Yes. And I really don't know what her capabilities are.,Bs,1
A,"So whatever we come up with, it may already be out there.",Bs,1
C,"But I think that's the type of thing we're talking about here when we say what it should be,",Be,1
C,"personal assistant and entertainment,",S,1
C,that you can just talk to,Bs,1
C,"and have it do, you know, set an appointment,",F,3
C,call somebody.,F,3
A,"Set an appointment and call somebody, those are use cases.",Be,3
A,[writing on paper],D,0
A,Make phone call.,Be,3
B,Integrated with a music service so it--,F,2
A,Play music.,Be,2
B,"--right, plays music, but also tracks your taste.",F,3
A,Track preferences. Keep going.,Be,2
B,"I'm just thinking that, like, what do individual stuff do?",Be,2
A,Play TV shows.,F,3
B,"They're always trying to suggest, yeah, like, TV shows versus what you previously watched.",Bs,3
C,"Well, it has to be TV shows, streaming video, movies, whatever.",Be,3
A,Remember choices. Movies.,F,3
C,"But also do the--when you think of personal assistant,",S,1
C,"also, you should be able to, like, setup stuff in your, you know, lock your doors,",Be,3
C,"turn on your lights,",Be,3
C,"see who's at the front door,",Be,3
C,"or you know, integrate with all those kinds of things.",F,2
C,"Like mine, right now, when someone's at the front door,",Be,2
C,Google,S,1
C,"says, ""There's someone at the front door,"" or ""There are people at the front door.""",Bs,2
C,It knows whether there's more than one.,Bs,1
A,"Oh, it does? Oh, okay. I didn't know that she did all that, she/he.",Bs,1
C,"Oh, yeah. I'm sure it's some app, but yeah.",S,1
A,"Let's see, identify guests. Okay,",F,2
C,What other types of personal assistant stuff?,S,2
B,"So do you think it'd be better to have something that, like, you buy one system or do you buy a system that tried to integrate systems that you already have?",F,1
A,That's a good question. I want it to self-integrate.,Be,1
A,[writing on paper],D,0
A,Self-integrate with devices.,S,1
A,"So that's, you know, discovery,",Bs,2
A,"operation,",Bs,2
A,"and I don't know what else. So, housework,",F,2
A,do we want it to vacuum our floor or tell this to vacuum our floor?,Be,3
A,"Do--well, I should say command housework.",Be,3
B,Because my Roomba,S,1
B,cannot keep a schedule.,Bs,3
C,"I don't have one, but I've heard you can tell it to go off at the same time every day.",Bs,1
C,"It's supposed to, right.",Bs,1
C,Is it expensive?,Bs,1
B,It's a lot more faith in its firmware than I have experienced.,S,1
A,Okay. So we want it,S,1
A,to be expandable,Be,1
A,so that someday we'll have a thing that dusts for us.,Be,1
B,"Yes, a dusting drone.",F,1
C,"In 2025, yeah.",R,1
A,A dusting drone.,S,1
C,There'll be a drone or a robot,S,1
C,"at our house, right?",S,1
A,"I'm going to write that down, dusting drone.",D,0
C,That can do all of that.,Bs,1
B,"But, yeah, the expandable thing.",S,1
B,I think you'd be toast,Bs,1
B,if it wasn't expandable.,Bs,1
A,How about reminders?,F,3
C,"Timers, reminders.",F,3
A,So that's by voice,Bs,2
A,or is there a better interface for that?,Be,2
A,"Like, do you want just somebody nagging you",Be,3
A,"or do you want to have to, like, check in, remind me what I'm supposed to be doing today?",Be,1
B,I think it should be selectable,F,1
B,whether or not it's voice or integrates,Bs,2
B,with your phone.,S,1
C,"or tablet, or something. Yeah.",S,1
A,"What do you call it, push or pull? Push versus pull or query versus--",Be,1
A,"And that's, like, for calendar.",F,3
A,What about your habits?,Be,3
B,It'll pop up on your TV that you're late. It'll pop up in your bathroom you're late.,Be,3
A,"Pop-ups. Calendar. What about, like, your habits, like, ""You didn't exercise today?""",Be,3
A,What's on your calendar?,Be,3
B,"Integrate with your fridge and it'll start telling you how many times you've already opened this fridge, 5 times at 10 p.m.",F,3
A,"Okay, now, wait a minute, now hold. Can we turn off these features? Feature selection,",F,2
A,I think it's already somewhere. Okay. We're getting there.,Bs,2
A,"What else? Before we move on, we want to make sure we capture all of our dream device features.",S,1
B,Integrate with the automated cat feeder. B: Feed the cat.,Be,3
A, So that's a chore.,Bs,3
A,"Lock door,",Be,3
A,"control lights,",Be,3
A,identify guests.,Be,3
C,"You had dusting in there somewhere, I thought.",Be,3
A,"Command housework, feed cats.",Be,3
A,"So you can do it when you're not home and remote,",Be,3
A,"we want it to be remote, right?",F,1
A,[writing on paper],D,0
A,Remote control.,Be,1
A,"By the way, I do have experience with a sprinkler controller",S,3
A,"which is wireless,",Bs,3
A,and it's wonderful.,Bs,3
A,And I've fallen in love with it. It's just an app and--,S,3
B,"It can control the, I think, heating/cooling your house, environmental controls.",Bs,3
C,It should be able to do all that from--,Bs,3
B,We do it all separate apps.,F,3
C,"Yeah, it's all separate apps",S,3
C,that you can download,Bs,3
C,on your phone,S,1
C,"and then do it or set up a timer, right?",Bs,2
B,Right. But the ultimate is to have--how do you integrate all this into one system?,Be,1
C,Into one thing.,S,1
A,Do you think it should be a single app?,F,1
A,"Just pages and pages of ""Do things for me.""",Be,1
A,"Okay, [writing on paper]",D,0
B,"Or if you had multiple there with pretty house-centric, then I guess you could maybe--",Be,1
A,Integrate with heavy equipment.,Be,2
B,The TV,S,3
B,being able to give you a pop-up,Bs,3
B,"reminder,",S,3
B,then I think you don't necessarily want to separate entertainment from chores and stuff.,Be,1
A,"Oh, that's true. But it's a personal assistant,",S,1
A,"so it can do, you know, whatever we deem we would want our assistant to do [unintelligible].",Bs,1
B,"If it can be mostly voice-controlled,",Be,1
B,maybe the multiple pages thing,S,3
B,wouldn't be as annoying.,Bs,3
A,"Oh, yeah, that's true. [writing on paper]",D,0
A,App,S,1
A,or voice control.,Bs,1
B,Where you only use this if you had to go in.,Be,1
A,"Okay. We don't want this to be involved in our love life, do we? Okay, all right.",F,1
A,"So that's really--like, that's over the line, okay. So nothing too personal.",Be,1
B,This is the family version.,R,1
B,Is there anything that we're missing if we throw in kids in there?,Be,1
B,We need to remind them to do chores or is there anything?,Bs,1
C,Right. Or appointments of where they need to be or that type of thing.,S,1
C,That's all under that.,Bs,3
B,Or tracking their location.,F,3
A,"Oh, limiting their TV time.",F,3
C,"Oh, yeah, limits. Entertainment limits, is that what we want to do?",Be,3
C,Screen time really.,S,3
A,"Oh, yes. And phone,",S,3
A,and computer.,S,3
B,"So, I guess, would it just shut it down or would it give you as the parent a warning?",Be,1
C,The option to set what--,S,1
A,"I say shut it down. I mean, why? Well, what do you think?",Bs,1
C,We'd probably have to put the option on there,S,1
C,to say what you want to happen when this,Bs,1
C,"--it's not really a timer going off, but when.",S,3
A,[writing on paper],D,0
A,Option to cut off.,Be,3
B,"Like, when they can start their school project until the night before and they'd be on computer all night long.",Bs,3
A,"All right, yeah. We forgot shut off the option.",Bs,3
C,"And you have to go in and change it,",Bs,3
C,change the option,S,3
C,that they can be on their computer after.,S,3
A,So option to cut off with override.,Bs,3
B,"Also, if there's multiple family members, also,",S,1
B,"and then it needs to somehow be able to tell if we will get personal preferences for the entertainment system, you know, who is sitting in front of the TV or who will ask the TV to turn on. Like, is it going to do visual recognition,",F,1
B,voice recognition?,F,1
C,"So we kind of are talking about all three of these things at once. What the system would be, well, we really have defined that. How the system works and interacts with people and what the personal assistant and entertainment system would provide.",R,1
C,So we kind of have a whole list of provide and how it interacts with people.,Be,1
A,"True. We've captured some features and some use cases, but what the system would be. [reading documents] Okay, produce these concept designs, develop--oh, goal is to produce a number of concepts and then develop one into a detailed design. Okay, so we have done that. So.",R,1
B,"but concept is you buy the whole system, right?",F,1
C,Yeah. Is it like a home system,S,1
C,that you buy?,Be,1
B,Or does it try to integrate with existing?,Be,1
B,"So you know, if you have a Wi-Fi controlled",Bs,3
B,auto-feeder,S,3
B,"or the Wi-Fi vacuum already,",S,3
B,"but you have to--like, that's a trickier thing to do, interfacing to all this.",Bs,2
A,"So even if you could slap like a Wi-Fi chip on there,",S,3
A,"on the vacuum, you know,",S,3
A,"just stick it on there,",S,3
A,"like, it still has to be integrated with",Bs,3
A,the device.,S,1
B,It still has to be on the API for the device.,F,1
A,"So there would be vendors who would come out with compatible equipment,",F,1
A,but we were just to find the interface,S,2
A,"and leave that to them to figure out,",Bs,2
A,like what the dusting drone would look like.,S,3
A,[writing on paper],D,0
A,for developing the detailed design.,R,1
B,"Well, that, I thought, is a good idea. Like, we provide hubs",S,2
B,with an interface,S,2
B,"for controlling,",Bs,2
B,and the expectation is that outside vendors would be able to interface.,Be,2
C,Yeah. So that's one concept. Is it a piece of hardware,S,1
C,and software,S,1
C,"that people would buy,",Bs,1
C,or do they use their existing laptop,S,1
C,or home computer,S,1
C,"and then they load our stuff onto it,",Bs,1
C,which then can connect with all these other things?,Bs,2
A,I can control,Bs,2
A,my music,S,2
A,"from my computer,",S,1
A,but my computer's in the office,S,1
A,"and I would really rather just be able to, like, load a CD",S,3
A,"Like, it's so, you know, I don't have an iPad anymore,",S,1
A,"and I guess you could stream music,",Be,2
A,but I don't really have a stream.,Bs,2
A,I don't like paying for things monthly.,Bs,3
A,"Now, it takes clicking and paying",Bs,1
A,and all this stuff that I don't really want to do.,Bs,1
A,So I kind of like the idea of having like a central console,S,3
A,that's separate.,Bs,3
B,I also like the central concept just because--,Bs,3
B,so I do have a streaming service,S,2
B,and I also have like 50 gigabytes of music.,S,3
B,"Like, you have to just keep upgrading",Be,3
B,your hard drive space.,S,3
B,And so if you're asking to put a whole bunch of other stuff,S,3
B,onto your existing computer.,S,1
B,"That, I could get frustrated with that, for me, because I'm always running out of computer space.",Bs,3
C,As people ,S,1
C,have movies,S,2
C,and music,S,2
C, all loaded,Bs,2
C,"on their computer or whatever device they have,",S,1
C,"you'd want to be able to communicate with that,",Be,2
C,"I guess, without, you know, have it be hooked up",Bs,2
C,to our central system,S,1
C,so you could access it wirelessly,Bs,1
C,"or whatever but not have to save everything on the system, the central system.",,1
A,"Really, you want, like, a terminal.",S,1
B,"That actually brings a point. Is this going to be cloud serviced or do you have it just in your home, all this information?",F,1
A,Right. [writing on paper],D,0
C,"Now, two different concepts. There's one that it's all in the cloud, which is--",Be,3
A,Versus local.,Be,3
C,"--a server somewhere, right?",S,3
A,"Music,",S,2
A,"movies, yeah.",S,2
C,Or can it just access?,Be,1
C,Because it doesn't change really what we want it to do,Bs,1
C,"if we say, ""Well, it's service,"" you know.",Bs,1
C,"It's really different concepts to say,",Bs,1
C,"Oh, it's something you buy,",Bs,1
C,"you have a console,""",S,3
C,or whatever at home,S,3
C,"that you do stuff on,",Bs,3
C,"or ""No, it's just an app or something",S,1
C,that you add to something you already have at home,Bs,1
C,"and everything goes through the cloud.""",S,3
C,"I mean, those are the different concepts of--",Bs,1
C,or maybe it could do all of those things.,F,1
C,"I mean, from a software standpoint, you could sell them",Be,3
C,something with the software on it,S,3
C,that controls everything,Bs,2
C,or just give them the software to put it,Be,3
C,on their own home computer.,S,3
A,"Yeah. Like, stream music from my PC,",Be,3
A,which we can already do.,Bs,3
B,Or we can do pretty much all these things one at a time,Bs,3
B,except for the dusting drone.,S,3
B,Right? But it's not integrated.,Bs,2
B,"That's where we're, like, trying to figure the ultimate integrated solutions",S,1
B,do not go in through each different app.,S,3
A,"[reading documents] So we need a detailed design before we get done in 40 minutes, with sketches and a verbal description.",R,1
A,[writing on paper],D,0
C,"When I say this, I want it to make a phone call.",Bs,1
C,"When I do this, I want it to do all these things, so.",Bs,1
B,"Like if you did have cloud,",S,3
B,"then that's something that you would touch outside of the system that is not part of your system design, you know",Bs,3
B,"It's something that, you know, you'll have to integrate",Bs,3
B,that's not part of the detailed design.,Bs,1
B,"""Is it just going to be on the computer?",S,1
B,Is it just going to be on the phone?,S,1
B,"Do you have physical hardware?""",S,3
B,"Because we think if it is a very, like, visual,",Be,1
B,"what's the first--like, all the things",S,1
B,it interacts with.,Bs,2
B,Is everything wireless communication?,F,3
A,So it's kind of--let me just start drawing.,D,0
C,"Because right now, with our Google Homes or the little mini Google things at home,",S,3
C,"like the streaming of music,",Bs,2
C,it's really all of them through my husband's phone.,S,1
C,So if he is not there with his phone,Bs,1
C,"and I say, ""Google,",S,3
C," play me whatever music,""",Bs,3
C,"it can only get to what, you know, it goes out to",Bs,1
C, YouTube,S,3
C,"and does stuff,",Bs,3
C,because somehow it can do that without going through,Bs,1
C, his phone.,S,1
B,"Yes. And that is an argument for having some kind of central console,",S,3
B,not just what's hooked to your hardware,S,3
B,if you're hooking up a family system.,Be,1
B,"Because otherwise, you've got that problem.",Bs,1
B,If somebody took their device with them.,S,1
A,"Okay. So the use case is, do we want an integrated console? Are we just kind of--?",S,3
B,"I think we're going in that way, yeah.",Bs,3
A,Okay. [writing on the board] I/we want an integrated console--,D,0
A,"Yeah, that's right. That centralizes entertainment options and personal data,",Bs,1
A,"I want to say, like, requests and actions, like commands.",S,3
B,"For multiple people, right. That's, like, a--",Be,1
A,"Okay, good. For multiple users.",Bs,1
B,So you're going to have to have a way of differentiating users.,Be,2
A,Okay. And it's really for the home.,S,1
A,[writing on the board] Okay. All right.,D,0
A,"So I would be inclined to say, like, this is what we think the console",S,3
A,"looks like,",Bs,3
A,only because the user interface,S,2
A,"turns out to be, I think, pretty significant,",Bs,2
A,[writing on the board],D,0
B,"I have in my--like, it's sort of, like, it's influenced",Bs,1
B,by Alexa or whatnot that's an object,S,1
B,"that's not necessarily like a big screen, right,",S,3
B,but you could enter the data and whatnot,Bs,3
B,"from either from your computer,",S,1
B,but that the central console,S,1
B,"isn't a big screen, right.",S,3
A,Okay. [writing on the board],D,0
B,It's something with some [unintelligible] maybe that you want in your house.,S,1
C,That you don't mind if people see.,Bs,1
A,Import music.,Bs,3
B,Stream from a device.,Bs,3
A,[writing on the board],D,0
C,So we have our box or whatever.,S,1
C,We need--what are our interfaces to everything?,S,2
C,"Is it all Bluetooth or all some sort of wireless, right?",F,3
B,"That's definitely not on my resume. But that, I guess, was leading to my question,is internet of things leaning",S,3
B,on Bluetooth?,S,3
B,And Bluetooth,S,3
B,"is getting stronger, so you can--it's not as limited by space as it used to be.",Bs,3
B,"Although walls,",S,3
B,"if you have a multistory house,",S,3
B,"and you're doing everything by Bluetooth,",S,3
B,you're going to need multiple repeaters or something.,S,3
B,We just know it's going to be wireless.,Be,3
C,"Who knows, in 2025, what is available?",R,0
A,"What new protocols could come out, yeah.",Be,3
B,Okay. So we just know that we want it wireless and--,Be,3
A,And it's just weirdly shaped.,Bs,1
B,We have a central console,S,3
B,and maybe repeaters.,S,3
A,Okay. [writing on the board],D,0
B,"Yes, play music,",Bs,3
B,play TV.,Bs,3
A,"Let's see. So this is, like, that's the source.",S,1
A,"So you could have, like, a middleman here if needed.",S,1
A,"Like, if I wanted to play music at work,",Be,2
A,"I should be able to say, you know, stream",Be,2
A,from my home computer.,S,1
A,"Let's see, how does that work?",Be,1
A,"If I can access it,",Be,1
A,like my little sprinkler device,S,1
A,has a MAC address.,S,1
A,now what the security protocol,S,3
A,"is for the app,",S,3
A,"you know, do I have to log in, I probably had to create a login ID,",F,3
B,"So, but we want to do more than just play, or do we? Is that play, you know--",Be,2
B,"is there any kind of control with personal preferences or,",Be,3
B,"you know, pop-up reminders",S,3
B,on your TV,S,3
B,that you have an appointment that you're about to be late for?,Bs,3
B,"So, does it just integrate with, say, ""Play Hulu,"" or is it, ""Play Johnny's favorite Hulu show?""",Be,3
C,Yeah. And it's even more than that.,Bs,1
C,It's the whole setup thing.,S,1
B,"So you have all this, like, feedback",F,3
B,from devices,S,3
B,that you are going to try to figure out preferences.,Bs,3
C,"And you'd still have to say, ""And play it on TV number one or the family room TV,"" you know what I mean?",Bs,3
B,This is the thing that we could set up.,Be,1
A,That's pretty good. That's pretty good.,Bs,1
A,[writing on the board],D,0
C,"But once you set it up, it'll be awesome, which--",Bs,1
A,"That's right, so there's a switch box.",S,3
C,So the biggest thing we have to figure out is the interface,S,2
C,"for setting things up,",Bs,2
C,"because currently, all of this exists pretty much that you could talk",Bs,2
C,to something,S,1
C,and tell it to do this and do that and different things.,Bs,1
C,They're all separate apps.,S,3
C,So it's figuring out how to get that all in one place.,Bs,1
C,"And is that more than just saying, ""Well, why can't I just, you know?"" Lots of things I need to just do",Be,1
C,on my phone right now.,S,1
C,I've downloaded the app,S,3
C,"to do this, and now I can do it, and I download the app.",Bs,3
A,[writing on the board],D,0
A,So maybe your phone,S,3
A,is another input.,S,3
A,So if your phone,S,3
A,"already knows things,",Bs,3
A,it can talk to this central.,S,1
A,"Now, we don't know what it is. It's a bot. It's a bot.",S,1
A,It might be a console.,S,1
A,It might take the form of a console.,Be,1
A,Maybe you could have it in any form you want.,Be,1
A,"Maybe it lives on your computer,",S,1
A,maybe it lives on some other box.,S,1
A,"Maybe you can access it right there from the kitchen counter, which is what I would like to do, you know.",Be,1
A,I would like a screen,S,3
A,big enough,Be,3
A,that I can scroll through,Be,3
A,"and say, well, no, I want to talk to it.",Be,3
A,"I want to be able to say like, ""Let me look at my music library,"" and choose.",Be,3
B,But you also want to see just suggest something.,Be,3
A,Yes. Okay. [writing on the board],D,0
B,"But for detailed design, so we are talking about like a machine learning operating centralized",F,1
B,that's trying to determine your taste from information it's receiving,Be,1
B,from multiple devices.,S,3
B,"Your TV,",S,3
B,your music.,S,2
A,Yes. Here's my PC.,S,1
A,This is phone.,S,1
A,"These are innies,",S,3
A,these are outies.,S,3
A,"This device is, like, my high-end Bose speakers.",F,1
A,This is the TV. This is the--,S,3
C,"Thermostat, I mean, you have all that, the thermostat,",F,3
C,the vacuum cleaner.,S,3
A,"Right, vacuum. What else we got here? The drone, the dusting drone.",S,3
A,"And then, inside of here are relationships between the innies and the outies, I guess.",Bs,3
C,"You know, like, if you come home early and you're in the kitchen,",Be,3
C,maybe you don't want the vacuum,S,3
C,to start because you're making dinner.,Bs,3
A,"How much do you want it to know? It does learn, but--",Be,1
B,"I guess that's a good question, how much do you want to program everything and how much do you want it to learn?",Be,1
A,"So, like, my little sprinkler controller,",S,3
A,"it senses the rain if I have sensors out there, which I don't,",Bs,1
A,"but it seems to think it knows things anyway, and sometimes I think it just makes things up.",Bs,1
A,But it can get the weather forecast from my area because it knows where I live.,Bs,1
A,So this is the Interweb.,F,1
A,It learns from the Interweb.,Bs,1
A,It does things.,Bs,1
A,This is my sprinkler system.,S,1
C,"Yeah. ""It's raining, don't forget your umbrella,"" or ""It's going to rain today, don't forget your umbrella.""",Bs,1
B,Yeah. But the detail is just that we want an interface,S,2
B,"that people would connect to, right,",Bs,2
B,because it's an infinite that you can add on to.,Bs,2
A,"These are the innies,",S,3
A,these are the outies.,S,3
A,It's really that simple. And there's relationships that are complex inside of here.,Bs,3
B,"Well, now, we focus on this bot.",S,1
B,"We don't need to interface with all this,",Bs,2
B,"but it also needs, if we're going to be talking to it,",Be,2
B,it needs microphone,S,3
B,and speaker.,S,3
A,"What's interesting is all this lives, all this exists.",Bs,3
A,"All we have to do is figure out how to--what this looks like inside, its innards,",Be,1
A,and then how to tie it,Be,1
A,"to a dust drone,",S,3
A,"how to allow a manufacturer to, you know, participate in the system. Okay, so.",Be,1
B,Right. We do need some physicality to it.,Be,1
B,If we're going to talk to it,Be,1
B, and it's going to talk to us.,Bs,1
A,[writing on the board],D,0
A,Okay. So here's the bot,S,1
A,and here's the dust drone.,S,3
C,There's an interface,S,2
C,"to the bot,",S,1
C,"and it will be something, right. It could be Bluetooth,",S,3
C,but it'll be something that everything can interface that way.,Be,2
A,So that's the key.,Bs,2
A,So we have to have like an instance of that,S,2
A,so that we can start to visualize this is how it would interface,Be,2
A,"with the dust drone, should one exists.",S,3
A,"And the dust drone is good because it doesn't exist,",Bs,3
A,"and we have to go, you know, what would that look like?",Be,3
A,How is that the same as something that does exist? How is it different? I don't know.,Be,3
A,[writing on the board],D,0
A,"But if we're going to take the bot first,",S,1
A,so what do we want to say about that? What's the innards?,S,3
B,"Is that speakers,",S,3
B,"microphone,",S,3
B,"and your Bluetooth receiver,",S,3
B,transmitter?,S,3
B,"Probably, you're still going to want your Wi-Fi.",S,3
A,[writing on the board],D,0
A,Bluetooth.,S,3
A,Wi-Fi. Rx/Tx.,S,3
B,"Doesn't this all communicate with Bluetooth,",Be,3
B,"but you might, if your initial programming is doing a lot,",Bs,3
B,you might want to do Wi-Fi,S,3
B,because you have a bigger bandwidth.,Bs,3
B,"So I think that seems-- And then the internal, right, you're going to have a pretty decent sized",Bs,3
B,central processing unit.,S,3
A,Right. So we don't need to choose.,Bs,3
B,"But we don't need graphics, right. I'm thinking we don't need to have a--",Bs,3
A,"A console,",S,3
A,a monitor?,S,3
B,I think you could connect through it with,Be,1
B,your Wi-Fi.,S,3
C,"Unless we want it to discover things,",Be,1
C,"and then it would just show it on the monitor,",S,3
C,"""I see this. I see this. I see this.""",Be,3
A,"I don't know how you don't need one, because otherwise--",Bs,3
B,Does Alexa have one?,S,1
C,If we're doing everything voice command.,Bs,1
C,But if you had a monitor,S,3
C,and then you could somehow tell it to find--,Be,1
B,Or you can have maybe an external monitor,S,3
B,that you can keep in the drawer,S,3
B,when you don't-- You don't have to require to have a--,Bs,3
C,"Right. Once you get it all set up, but at setup time,",Bs,1
C,a monitor,S,3
C,"would be nice for that type of practical stuff, for it to say, ""Okay, over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, I have discovered this that has a programming that will work with this. I've discovered this and I've discovered that.""",Bs,1
C,And if you have that smarts,Be,1
C,in your TV,S,3
C,"and in your dust drone and in your whatever,",S,3
C,then that's where I would think a monitor,S,3
C,"would be very useful,",Bs,3
C,even if you're using voice command.,Bs,2
A,[writing on the board],D,0
C,Because you might--when you were telling it,S,1
C,"to do stuff,",Bs,1
C,you might not want to have to be right in front of it looking at things.,Bs,1
C,"But once you have it set up, because you can just say, ""Turn on the TV,"" or whatever.",Bs,1
A,That's true. Right. And maybe I don't know if my dust drone,S,3
A,is compatible with it.,Bs,1
A,So it would be nice to kind of see.,Bs,1
A,"And I think this already exists, a lot of this.",Bs,3
A,"You know, I don't have a smart house,",S,3
A,"but they're advertising this stuff all over the place. So a lot of what we're talking about, I think, is already out there.",Bs,2
C,"Yeah, the majority of it will be having everything common enough",Be,1
C,in all of the smart things,S,1
C,that can then talk to it.,Bs,1
B,Yes. What I think we were trying to differentiate yourself would be that this unit itself,S,1
B,will do differentiate between who's talking to it in terms of preferences in taste.,Be,1
B,It'll do preferences in taste versus just relying on all these individual things.,Be,1
A,[writing on the board],D,0
B,"And it's a centralized way that you could maybe also control when the vacuum--like, ""Oh, I set the cat feeder and vacuum cleaner to go off at the same time."" But it causes anxiety in the cat, so.",F,1
C,So we're going to have to change that.,Bs,1
B,"So, like, if it's a central, ",Be,1
B,"it could see things,",Bs,1
B,like a centralized control,S,1
B,of all these things.,S,1
B,But I don't think you'd have a competitive product,Bs,1
B,if you try to give us everything when we have all these other piecemeal that we've probably purchased already.,Bs,1
B,"Then, in five years, like,",R,1
B, throw all that away,Bs,1
B,and buy this really expensive,Bs,1
B,that has everything. I don't think.,Bs,1
C,"So I think the main thing is, like, the discovery and the differentiating between users.",Be,1
A,"Okay. So we need a detailed design on something. So we have to, like, somehow, this is probably part of their research study, like.",R,1
C,"""We know there's going to be an interface,",S,2
C,"we don't know for sure what it is yet, but these are the things that we need to define is how discovery of all these things can be done,",Be,2
C,"and the other thing is the users and preference,",Be,2
C,like it's voice recognition,Be,3
C,"and stuff like that."" Because you can tell it.",Be,3
A,[writing on the board],D,0
B,Tracking individual users whether or not,Bs,3
B,you like that idea in your house.,S,3
B,"Like, I think that would be a key differentiator",Bs,3
B,"is you have one unit,",S,1
B,but it's tracking different users.,Bs,2
C,And you set up things.,Bs,3
C,"You can already set up parental controls on stuff for kids,",F,3
C,"but the difference here, would this be able to understand that a kid is saying, ""Hey, turn on this, you know. Turn such and such channel on on the TV,"" ",Be,3
C,"and it'll say, ""No, you're not authorized to watch that,"" type of thing.",Be,3
C,The recognition and the preference.,Be,3
A,But we're on permissions.,Be,3
A,[writing on the board],D,0
A,"Permissions, authorizations.",Be,3
A,So I still think we're supposed to get specific on [reading documents] develop one of those concepts into a detailed design.,R,1
A,And present sketches and a verbal description of your solution.,R,1
C,"But the sketch would be, yeah, it's a box",S,1
C,"with all those things, speaker,",S,3
C,"microphone,",S,3
C,"Bluetooth,",S,3
C,"Wi-Fi,",S,3
C,Rx/Tx.,S,3
A,"Okay, that's good.",Bs,3
C,It has to have a CPU.,S,3
A,Okay. [writing on the board],D,0
B,And then an interface.,S,2
A,"Memory, tons of memory.",S,3
B,"So you're going to have to have something with a visual screen, whether it's (???) to it or not.",S,3
C,"Oh, yeah, some sort of monitor.",S,3
A,Okay. All right. So there's like an all-in-one kind of a device,S,3
A,with a motherboard,S,3
A,that has all of these devices on it,S,3
A,and solid-state drive.,S,3
A,And then it has to have a microphone.,S,3
B,That's the physical hardware that we need.,S,3
A,Yeah. And this is the bot. This is really the bot.,S,1
A,"Now, as far as software goes, see, this is the easy part. Now, the software, you know,",S,3
A,so what does that look like?,Be,1
A,It's voice recognition.,Bs,1
A,It's all of this.,Bs,1
A,So let's draw a diagram [writing on the board] that connects all of those things together.,D,0
A,"So source of command, so that's the voice recognition.",Bs,1
A,"So that's, like, user recognition.",Bs,1
A,User preference.,Bs,1
B,"I think what source we were saying also, command",Bs,1
B,"though can be coming from, not necessarily just voice, right.",Bs,1
B,Can you control it with something else?,Be,1
A,"Oh. So, yeah, it's user recognition, however that's done.",Bs,1
A,So whether it sees you,Bs,1
A,or you scan your fingerprint,Bs,1
A,or it recognizes your voice.,Bs,1
A,Permissions and authorizations. These are the same. Okay.,Bs,2
A,[writing on the board],D,0
A,"So, do we have a central authority here?",F,1
A,Is there like a system controller?,S,2
A,You know. There's not a state machine of any sort.,Bs,1
C,"Well, there will need to be when--because that's one thing too. You could have so many things connected.",Be,2
C,"Is there a limit to how many things it can be doing at once, you know what I mean?",Be,1
C,"Like, you're watching TV,",S,3
C,it still has to be able to turn on,Be,3
C,the vacuum,S,3
C,and have it be going at the same time.,Be,3
C,"Not that it's really using it, once it gets it turned on, it's just a--",Bs,1
A,This is the UI here.,S,2
C,I guess none of it is.,Bs,1
C,"Because once you command it or even if you say, ""Stream this video on such and such a TV,"" after it's going,",Bs,1
C,"it doesn't necessarily need to be going through our bot after that, right?",S,1
C,"I guess, maybe it knows that it is because you might want to say, ""Pause it,"" or whatever, but maybe you're just off/on.",Bs,1
A,So we decided this user interface,S,2
A,"might be a console,",S,3
A,[writing on the board],D,0
A,"but there were all those other things that we had over, in the other side of this board, which is how this thing takes inputs.",Be,1
A,So that's like family members and I want to say console.,S,3
A,"And this was the PC,",S,3
A,and this is the phone.,S,3
C,Things. Family members is using one of those things.,Bs,3
B,I think those would all just go under sort of like a source of command user.,S,3
B,"Like, so the system controller,",S,1
B,they can talk to all of our other things.,Bs,1
B,"That's, you know, going to be--it interfaces and talks to all the things,",Bs,1
B,"but that's not necessarily--you know, the big functions are what you have right there, discovery. That's, you know, not--",Bs,1
A,"Yeah, these are all--you're right, these are internal",Bs,3
A,to the bot.,S,1
B,--user recognition.,Bs,3
A,These are internal to the bot. And so I think devices--,S,1
B,"You know, it controls devices,",Bs,1
B,so that would just be another one of its functions.,Bs,1
B,"You have a system,",S,1
B,"it does discovery,",Bs,1
B,it does device control.,Bs,1
A,But there's IO here.,S,3
A,[writing on the board],D,0
A,So this is where we are. This is the boundary of the system.,S,1
A,And these are external interfaces up there.,S,2
A,"Okay, so now, so this is the software.",S,3
A,"I don't know what else is in here, something, probably, like self-test or something or some sort of maintenance.",F,3
B,"I mean, so you have discovery.",Bs,3
B,"We talked about, well, probably looking at Bluetooth verticals",S,3
B,or IoT verticals for the discovery.,S,3
B,User recognition,Bs,3
B,is the microphone.,S,3
A,[writing on the board],D,0
A,"IoT,",S,3
A,"Bluetooth,",S,3
A,"Wi-Fi,",S,3
A,"and manual, like I entered it [unintelligible] like, ""Go look for this thing.""",Bs,3
A,"I guess, does Bluetooth do that or? Yeah.",Bs,3
A,"Coupling, okay. What else?",Bs,3
A,"Yeah. Oh, yeah, the devices. Okay, so let's just do this.",S,3
B,"Do we do--I guess, are we just going to--if I connect to it",S,1
B,"on my phone,",S,3
B,it recognizes who I am. User preferences is internal.,Bs,1
B,That's just your CPU memory.,S,3
C,"Right, you just entered.",Bs,3
A,"Yeah, so this is some honk of software, which we could design.",S,3
B,"And then permission, authority is also software.",Bs,3
C,"Internal software, yeah.",S,3
B,And what is bot maintenance in that last box?,S,1
A,"Backup. Here we go. Okay. Rx/Tx is really-- Okay,",S,3
A,so there's the devices,S,3
A,that it's controlling.,Bs,1
A,So this is our dust drone here.,S,3
A,"Yeah, one instance of this, which is a dust drone.",S,3
A,"So a family comes in and says, ""Go dust,"" and then it comes back out and commands the thing to go dust.",Bs,3
A,So what would that really look like?,Be,3
A,"So it's got a little chip in it,",S,3
A,Bluetooth or whatever.,S,3
B,It's a little drone,S,3
B,"with then just like a feather duster coming off the bottom,",S,3
B,and it hovers around and dusts.,Bs,3
C,It's just a duster.,S,3
A,--like an articulated arm.,S,3
B,So it can get in the corners.,Bs,3
A,And it kind of rolls around.,Bs,3
A,It's on one of those things where you can spin like this.,Bs,3
A,"So it's got a base,",S,3
A,[writing on the board] and it's got these--,D,0
A,"So it can spin in any direction, I guess. Anyway.",Bs,1
C,"It's literally a drone,",S,3
C,so it's above whatever you're dusting.,Bs,3
C,It flies.,Bs,1
C,"It has to be pretty sensitive though to, like--",Be,1
B,"It's what I'm imagining, all the lamps being broken.",Bs,1
C,--to touch stuff and back away and go around without pushing it over.,Be,1
B,It can come up from above and come down.,Be,1
A,So this would be made by Hoover. So we'll get them onboard.,Be,3
B,"I don't know, maybe we should, you know, we'll start with our entire personal entertainment, personal assistant system",S,1
B,and a duster.,S,3
C,Because that is really the most important device,S,3
C,that can connect to it.,Bs,1
A,"He needs a good name. Hoover is a really good name. In England, it's a verb. You hoover it up, which makes me laugh. But he needs a good name. So marketing is everything. We're a little off the engineering now, but anyway. Names are everything. So if you guys have a good name for this or this, let's label it.",F,1
A,Hooman.,S,1
C,Wooman. Wooman.,S,0
B,"I don't know, that might be worse.",Bs,1
A,"A name, like Alexa, Cortana.",S,1
A,So it's your personal assistant and entertainment.,S,1
