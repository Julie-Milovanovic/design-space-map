B," almost like, you know, when you talk about an entertainment system,",R,1
B,"you're talking about visual. You know, watching movies,",F,2
B," playing games,",F,2
B,almost like they have with the current voice command.,F,2
C,[writing on paper] Alexa.,D,0
B,"Dish, Alexa, something like that.",S,2
B,"Seriously, where you can pick what you want.",Bs,2
B,"If you want to watch movies,",Be,2
B,"play games,",Be,2
B,do finance stuff.,F,2
B,"I mean, really, anything.",F,2
C,"But it is entertainment, right?",R,1
B,"You have so many different topics you could do, right? It's just not watching movies.",Be,2
A,"Yeah, I think, kind of, for me, though, if I was to say what just to brainstorm and try to project out to 2025, that all of those ",R,0
A,All of our technology increase is soon to be centered around ,S,2
C,"The phone? Right, yeah.",Bs,1
A,Which isn't really a phone anymore. It's a ,Bs,1
B,Computer.,S,1
A,"It's a personal computer that we all carry around, right?",Bs,2
A,"So I think, for me, the central part of this would be that I mean, the first idea that comes to me is that different members of the family",S,2
A,would be able to interact,F,2
A,through their phone.,S,2
C,[writing on paper],D,0
C,"Okay, there's phones. There's also VR, right? Virtual reality.",F,2
C,That's a big component that's coming online.,Bs,2
B,[writing on paper],D,0
A,"Yeah, yeah. We're seeing a lot of that around, too, yeah. [writing on paper]",D,0
C,"Now, it's a family thing.",R,2
B,Wireless. Everything's wireless.,F,2
C,"Yeah, it's got to be wireless. Yep.",Bs,2
C,"And then they can tie together, right?",F,1
C,"Just like gaming systems or anything else,",S,1
C,"it's got to be able to pull together, right? Connectivity.",Be,1
A,"Okay. Well, we're going to present our final on that. I guess you want to see our work on that, too? [writing on board]",D,0
C,"[reading documents] So we're trying to answer what the system would be,",S,1
C,how it works,Be,1
C,and interacts,Be,1
C,"with people,",S,1
C,what the personal assistant,R,1
C,and entertainment system,R,1
C,would provide.,Be,1
B,It could have settings on there,F,2
B,"for different family members,",S,2
B,"to know what age they are, you know, to know who's on there and what they're using.",F,2
B,"Mm-hmm. That's why I was thinking, if it's entertainment, what do you do now for entertainment?",Be,1
B,"You do the virtual reality,",Be,2
B,but you're playing a game or something.,Be,2
C,"Everything's got a screen right now, right?",S,3
B,Either on the computer,S,2
B,or a TV.,S,2
C,It's all visual.,Bs,2
B,Some kind of monitor or the virtual.,S,3
B,"But there's maybe a central device, like a what do you call it? PC module or motherboard, for example,",S,2
B,that you can select whether it goes,Be,2
B,to a phone,S,2
B,or a TV,S,2
B,or a virtual.,S,2
B,It can spider the technology,F,1
B,"out of a device, maybe.",S,1
B,"It depends on what you would pick, right, what you're trying to gain out of it.",Be,1
C,Being able to have multiple users seeing the same thing,Be,2
C,or interacting on the same ,Be,2
A,Yeah. So we're talking about interactive. [writing on board],D,0
B,"And it can beyond in the household, the unit. It probably could be ",F,1
B,#NAME?,S,2
C,"Yeah, if you're going the next step, with phones right now,",S,2
C,you've got earbuds,S,3
C,"that are wireless, right?",Bs,3
C,"Because you have two things. You've got visual input,",S,2
C,"you got audio input, right?",S,2
C,"You got to take the next step with audio input, you know?",Be,2
C,You've got these little things,S,3
C,sticking out,Bs,3
C,"of your ears, you know.",S,3
C,"Okay. What's the next step with audio, you know?",Be,2
C,"How can you get it smaller,",F,2
C,better?,F,2
A,[writing on board],D,0
A," Yeah, because the latest thing, as you've seen, everyone's",S,2
A,wearing,Bs,2
A,"headphones everywhere, right?",S,3
C,"Well, and there's the wireless ones",S,3
C,that they're just sticking out,Bs,3
C,"of their ears, right?",S,3
C,These little buds,S,3
C,sticking out.,Bs,3
A,"Yeah, so you probably have to provide for either of those.",Be,2
A," There seems to be, like, kind of a preference.",Bs,2
A,Some guys like big headphones.,S,3
A,Others have the earbuds.,S,3
B,"And that's because, again, their bodies, too, can't and I'm just mentioning this because there are certain people's ears, their ear canals and whatnot, like myself",S,3
B,", can't wear",Bs,2
B,the earbuds.,S,3
B,So they need the headphones.,S,3
B,So they can't just have one. So you'd have to have multiple means.,Be,2
B,So that's why I wear the ones,S,3
B,"over the ears,",S,3
B,"because, like, those ones",S,3
B,easily fall right out for me.,Bs,2
A,[writing on board],D,0
C,"What if they mold the inside of your ear, to the shape of your ear?",F,2
B,That could be a solution right there.,Bs,2
C,And then put it right in there.,S,3
C,And then it fits,Bs,3
C,"your ear, John.",S,3
B,"Yeah, see, I would like that. It's a good idea.",Bs,3
C,[writing on paper] How about a pre-molded ,D,0
B,For the user. ,S,2
B,[writing on paper],D,0
C,#NAME?,Be,3
A,Big ears.,S,3
C,That's an idea.,Bs,3
C,"What other concepts? Virtual reality, I mean, you can use your phone",S,2
C,right now for that. They already do that.,Bs,2
A,They clip the box on.,Bs,3
C,"Yeah. They clip it in, and they'd split",Bs,3
C,"the screen, right?",S,3
A,"Yeah. And I think, along those lines, I mean, you're starting to see the availability of things, like you can attend an NBA game.",Be,2
A,Watch the basketball game as if you're on the front row.,Be,2
A,So we probably have to account for that. That type of entertainment experience,R,2
A,is going to be preferred by some people.,Be,2
A,"If we leave that out, you're probably sunk.",Bs,2
C,Yeah. I think that's got to be an option. It's definitely coming.,Bs,2
B,"Here's thinking 2025,",R,0
B,"too, with, like, the field we're in, automotive, you know? What if that entertainment system",R,1
B,"can connect to your car, too, in the future?",F,2
B,So not only when you're in the minivan with the kids ,S,2
C,That's a good thought.,Bs,2
C,[writing on paper],D,0
B,You know. You connect,Be,1
B,it,S,1
B,to the same system in the car.,S,2
C,Yep. My phone,S,2
C,"already connects,",Bs,2
C,"but take it to the entertainment level, right?",Be,1
A,[writing on board],D,0
C,"Because the whole ""the screens in your car,""",S,3
C,"those are kind of almost the past, right? People don't use them.",Bs,3
C,They just use their phone.,S,2
C,Right? They don't even look,Be,2
C,at the screens anymore.,S,3
C,They're all doing their own thing. So ,Bs,2
A,"If you could you know, I don't know. I don't know if this might be going beyond the scope, but if you could come up with something",Be,1
A,that people could take,Be,2
A,in the car,S,2
A,"with them that right now, you're kind of like, my iPhone",S,2
A,works well,Bs,2
A,with my Honda,S,2
A,"and not so great with my Nissan, right?",S,2
C,[writing on paper],D,0
A,You're kind of limited by the vehicle's technology,S,2
A,of what you can do. ,Bs,2
B,If you can find some way to overcome that ,Be,2
B,That might be beyond the scope of what we're doing here.,Bs,2
B,"If you had like a PC module,",S,2
B,"you know, that has all this built into it,",S,2
B,and it plugged,Be,2
B,"into a cigarette lighter,",S,3
B,then you take it with you.,Be,2
B,"Because regardless of what car you have or vehicle,",S,2
B,you want to be able to put it,Be,2
B,in any vehicle,S,2
B,"and be able to communicate,",Be,2
B,"you know, the entertainment system.",R,1
C,Personal assistant.,R,1
A,[reading documents] So we need to figure out what the system looks like and ,S,1
A,"Yeah. So that I was kind of focused on the entertainment system, but this also includes personal assistant. So that is relevant.",Bs,1
A,Your personal assistant has got to be useful,Be,1
B,in your vehicle or wherever you are.,S,1
A,What would you use a personal assistant for? Let's just look at that.,Be,0
B,"Right now, people are using it primarily for how to get from point A to point B, how to communicate.",F,2
C,"Google Maps,",F,3
C," how to get directions, right? How to look up phone numbers, that kind of stuff. Maybe even ",S,2
C,If a personal assistant,Bs,1
B,"could analyze data, like it could analyze, ""I want to buy this thing, but I want it at the best price and I want it at "" you know. If it can go out ",F,2
C,"""Show me location.""",Be,2
B,"Analyze the different locations, is it going to be the best price on Amazon? ",F,2
B,"Is there a local brick and mortar that is cheaper and I can get it today and drive there, get it? If it could do that kind of analytics ",S,3
A,"But that's higher level. I mean, that  A: [writing on board] ",D,0
B,So this is entertainment.,R,1
C,Maybe not.,Be,1
C,If I ask Siri,S,2
C,and Alexa,S,2
C,"a question, half the time they don't even know how to respond.",Bs,3
B,B: So a personal assistant's. ,R,1
B,got to have a lot more access to high-level algorithms and ,Be,2
C,"If we're thinking '25, who knows?",R,2
C,"Web scraping kind of tools, right?",S,2
C,[writing on paper],D,0
C,That's a real personal assistance.,Bs,1
B,They're not smart enough.,Bs,1
B,"But that's what everyday people I mean, not engineers, but your typical soccer mom and stuff,",S,2
A,"that's what they're going to use it for, right? They're going to look it up on there for information.",Bs,2
A,So you were saying your personal assistant,S,1
A,to evaluate price.,Be,2
C,[writing on board],D,0
B,"Maybe a choice for purchasing. Yeah, like a purchase.",Be,2
C,I think this is more of a software piece,S,2
C,that goes into our device.,S,1
B,"Whatever this device is, that's something that could be upgradable and changed over time.",F,1
C,But what is this thing? Is it a phone? Is it a next-generation phone,S,1
C,or is it some other thing where it's something,S,1
B,you take with you?,Be,1
B,"Yeah. And I envision it as like a Siri device, in my head, something like that. Some kind of main computer, like a Siri,",S,1
B,that you communicate to,Be,1
A,that can be wireless.,Bs,2
A,"That's a complication,",Bs,1
A,"because if you go there right now, we're all bounded",Bs,1
A,by what our phones,S,1
A,will do.,Bs,1
A,"We're not able to, like, program",Bs,2
A,"I mean, Apple or the Android phones",S,1
C,"will constantly add features, but ",Bs,2
C,Yeah. So give it more flexibility like a computer,Bs,2
C,where you can upload your own either application,Be,2
A,or give it flexibility and not have it tied down.,Be,2
A,"So kind of where we're going, it's a little bit of a touchy subject",Bs,1
A,because some of the things we're discussing is almost like replacing what our phones,S,1
A,are doing,Bs,1
A,or upgrades to the phones.,Bs,1
B,"Yeah, our focus is on the entertainment system.",R,1
C,"And a personal assistant, a next-generation personal assistant.",R,1
B,"So we need to decide, is this something that's  B: Entertainment system. A: You know, entertainment, what is it? You know, what are we looking for these? I guess we ought to decide what ",Bs,1
B,"Movies,",Be,2
C,"games, I mean ",Be,2
A,"So entertainment, maybe define what are we providing. Music, video.",Bs,2
B,[writing on board],D,0
B,"Younger kids now, it's YouTube videos. You know, they're surfing all sorts of stuff like that, right? YouTube videos and gaming. That's big. Music, video, gaming.",Bs,2
B,"Entertainment, watching a basketball game. B: Okay, TV. A: A live game on the go. B: Yeah, sports.",F,2
C,What if you're in the car and you want to watch a live game?,F,2
C,What about exercise?,F,2
B,Is that entertainment? I guess it could be.,Bs,1
B,Only if you're watching WFN. C: That's a television station.,Be,3
A,"I only say that because, I mean, entertainment and exercise, they're kind of separate goals,",Bs,2
A,but we all want to be entertained while we're exercising if possible.,Be,2
B,"I mean, that's why you guys are getting the Zwift thing, right?",S,2
C,"That's true. That's where that's going now, some of the market, is entertainment.",Bs,2
A,"Yeah, exercise. Yeah, throw that on there.",Bs,2
B,[writing on board],D,0
C,"Because as I look at Zwift, reading it  A: Takes your mind off the pain, right? And as I look at Zwift,",Bs,2
B,it looks like it's a game.,Bs,2
B,"So I'm looking at it for that reason, too, not just a boring sit B: on the bike.",Bs,2
B,"Yeah, you're combining those two elements together, combining gaming and exercise.",S,2
A,That's a selling point for me.,Bs,2
A,What about reading?,F,2
C,[writing on the board],D,0
C,What about communicating with family? Would that be entertainment?,F,2
A,That's more like our phone.,S,2
C,Social networks.,Bs,2
B,"Social, yeah. Social media. I would consider that entertainment. That's all it's good for, right?",Bs,2
A,"All right. So we got to come up with a concept then that has all that in it, does those stuff, and then ",R,1
A,"Yeah, I don't know if we can come up with something",S,1
A,that does everything.,Bs,1
B,"We might have to start saying what are we going to target. Well, but let's first talk about what can work for everything, right? Sports viewing, right? Okay. And then ",Be,2
B,"Yeah. Over here, we kind of talked about  Okay, that's the entertainment portion of it.",S,1
A,And maybe assistant portion. Personal assistant.,S,1
C,"We talked about directions, purchase, using it to make purchases and things. A: Financial decisions. For purchases.",Be,2
C,"Yeah. And then it could be banking, financial, you know.",Be,2
C,"If you're going to get a loan or do whatever, you know, all those types of decisions,",Be,3
A,[writing on board],D,0
B,Something that goes out and looks for the best interest rates or whatever. B: Yeah. Find you the best deal.,Be,3
A,"Or you could even throw in there, like, restaurants based on cost and, you know.",F,2
C,"What about investments? B: Yeah. Day trading. A: It could give you a market update, a daily market update.",F,2
C,"What is this thing? I mean, the first obvious choice which does all this currently",Bs,1
C,"is your phone, right?",S,1
B,"I mean, it would do all of these things right now. I mean, yeah, some of it's got some room to improve, but.",Bs,1
A,"So I think, maybe, when you start saying ""entertainment system,""",R,1
A,it becomes does that become something that you have a larger screen,S,3
A,that's home-based,S,1
B,that you could do all these things?,Be,1
A,That's where I was going with it.,Bs,1
A,Instead of having to sit there,Bs,2
A,and scroll through,Bs,2
A,a little screen,S,3
A,"on your phone,",S,1
A,you've got a system,S,1
A,in your home,S,1
A,that does all the things,Bs,1
A,that your phone,S,1
B,would do.,Bs,1
B,"Because in a way, you sort of have that when you're at home.",Bs,2
B,"Because you can look at Netflix,",Bs,2
B,"you can look at YouTube,",Bs,2
B,you can do your banking,Bs,2
B,"on your TV. C: Smart TVs, yeah.",S,2
B,It's not a smart process.,Bs,2
B,It doesn't give you the personal-assistant aspect of it.,Bs,1
B,If there's nothing you can take with you,Bs,2
B,"in the vehicle,",S,2
B,so you need something ,S,1
B,that can either link itself or connect,Be,2
B,either from your home,S,2
B,to your vehicle,S,2
B,or to your phone,S,2
A,or something.,S,2
C,"So I think what you're both saying, we combine them together.",Be,1
C,"And I have, like, right now, like, a home server,",S,3
C,"and I can access my own music, video, and all that stuff through",Bs,2
C,"my phone,",S,2
C,but all that stuff's stored at home.,S,2
C,We could have a similar concept,Be,1
C,"where, at home,",S,2
C,"you have all that data,",S,2
C,or if it's games or whatever.,S,2
C,"If you need to store stuff,",Be,2
C,"that can be at the home base,",S,2
B,and you could have a nice screen there.,S,3
B,You can link it anywhere,Be,2
B,you have a wireless signal,S,3
C,or satellite signal.,S,3
C,"But then, through your phone,",S,2
B,"you could access it anywhere, right? I don't know.",Be,2
A,Almost like a hotspot.,S,3
A,"Yeah. So it's like, right now, I can access Dish Network",Bs,3
A,on my phone,S,2
A,"on a limited basis,",Bs,2
A,but I'm subject to what Dish Network,S,2
A,provides,Bs,2
B,"in that software, right?",S,2
B,"But it's only dealing with one aspect of what the objective is. I think the part of the objective is, you know, being an assistant.",R,1
B,"Dish can't be an assistant, right?",Bs,2
B,So it's like the phone,Bs,2
B,"does little bits and pieces of what we're talking about here,",Bs,2
B,"but we need a server,",S,2
B,some kind of system,S,1
B,that does all of that.,Be,1
B,So we need some kind of main system,S,1
B,"to the server,",S,2
B,"the main computer, the main brains",S,2
B,of this whole product,S,1
B,that holds all that.,Bs,2
B,"So you can pick TV,",S,2
A,you can ask it questions.,Be,2
A,"Okay. But let's stop for a second, though. Are we looking for something that does all the things",Be,1
A,that your phone,S,1
A," like, when you're away",Be,2
A,"from home,",S,2
A,"your phone can do all these things,",Bs,1
A,"but you're limited to a little, tiny screen",Bs,3
A,"and a little, tiny speaker.",Bs,3
B,Or else you've got to carry some kind of a ,Be,3
B,Monitor,S,3
A,and hookup plug?,S,3
A,Earbuds,S,3
A,"or something, you know.",S,3
A,You don't have great sound.,Bs,2
A,You don't have a great screen.,Bs,2
A,Are we saying that what we want to hear is for people to have the experience at home,Be,2
A,"but better sound,",Be,2
A,"better screen, right?",S,2
A,Because if this is a home-based,Be,1
A,"entertainment system,",S,1
A,"we're saying  Because the thought I was just having a minute ago was, I often find myself sitting at home, you know. B: Watching your phone.",Be,2
A,Doing stuff on my phone,S,2
B,"on this little, tiny screen.",Bs,3
A,Instead of a laptop.,S,2
A,If I could somehow project,Be,2
A,everything,S,2
A,"that's in my phone,",S,2
A,"because I don't want to have two different systems, right?",S,1
A,That's why I wind up using,Bs,2
A,"the phone,",S,2
A,because everything's,S,2
A,in here.,S,2
A,And if I go boot up,Bs,2
A,"my laptop,",S,2
A,now I've got to use,Bs,2
A,", you know, different software,",S,2
A,different systems.,S,2
B,I've got to wait for it to boot up.,Bs,2
C,You want to bundle everything.,S,1
C,He wants it. He wants a phone,S,1
C,that's more like a computer.,S,1
C,"But when I set my phone down at home,",Be,1
C,I can have it flash onto this,Bs,2
C,screen.,S,3
C,I could have a keyboard input to it.,S,3
B,It's just like a computer.,S,1
A,"That's a great idea, actually.",Bs,1
A,If I could have a little console,S,3
A,"that I would sit down in, right?",Bs,3
A,You sit down and there's a screen,S,3
A,"right there,",S,3
A,"kind of like they do on some of the movies or whatever, where the guy's up there,",Bs,2
A,"waving his hands,",Bs,3
A,and the screen,S,3
A,is reacting,Bs,3
C,"to his hands, right?",S,3
A,[writing on paper],D,0
A,If you could do all the things that you do,Be,2
A,"on your phone screen,",S,3
A,"but on a bigger screen,",S,3
B,"so that you're not doing this stuff, right?",Bs,2
B,"Yeah, that should just  Honestly, if the phone",S,1
B,"has all that ability,",Bs,2
B,that's just a matter of communicating wirelessly,Be,2
B,to that smart device.,S,1
C,"And one of the bullets, how it works, how it interacts with ",R,1
C,"So like Brian says, you'd want one device",S,1
C,"to do everything, right?",Be,1
C,"You know, some things",Be,2
C,are easier,Bs,2
C,to do on my computer.,S,2
C,Some things are not easy,Bs,2
C,"on the phone, right?",S,2
C,It'd be nice,Bs,1
C,to take your phone,S,1
C,Get a keyboard.,S,3
C,It links up to a monitor,S,3
C,"and a keyboard,",S,3
C,"just like a computer,",S,1
C,and I could see it,Be,2
C,"on the screen,",S,3
C,"just like a computer,",S,1
C,with a mouse,S,3
C,and everything.,S,3
C,Some interfaces that way.,Bs,2
C,"Or gaming. Maybe I'm gaming,",Be,2
C,I want it here.,Be,2
C,"If I'm on the go,",Be,2
C,then it's right here,Bs,2
C,on the phone.,S,1
C,"So that's why I would say [reading documents] if you had kind of, like, this home-server idea,",Be,2
C,and your TV's,S,2
C,"hooked up to it,",S,2
C,you have a monitor,S,3
C,and a keyboard,S,3
C,"for, like, your you know? But you have it hooked",S,3
C,"it to wireless,",S,2
B,And that can all be wireless.,Bs,2
C,"Everything, yeah. Even the keyboard.",S,3
A,"That all can be wireless, right? Not too strong connections, but, yeah.",Bs,2
A,"So right now, home servers,",S,3
C,"you can do it, but unless you're really computer literate ",Be,2
C,The software,S,2
A,is the problem.,Bs,2
A,You want to take the time to link,Be,2
A,"everything up,",S,2
A,"and then you've got your own unique system, right?",S,1
A,So where you're going is that if you could create,Be,1
A,some kind of a module,S,1
A,or system,S,1
B,"Yeah, because I don't do all that at home right now,",Bs,2
B,run,Bs,2
B,"your computer,",S,2
B,"your laptops,",S,2
B,"your TV,",S,2
B,like some people,S,2
B,do to watch,Bs,2
A,Apple TV and all that.,S,2
A,You bring,Be,2
A,"it home,",S,2
A,you plug it,Be,3
A,"into your Wi-Fi,",S,3
A,or maybe even make it simpler,Bs,2
A,as you don't even have to have a router,S,3
A,or anything.,S,3
A,You just plug it,Be,3
A,"into the wall,",S,3
A,and it,S,1
B,"figures it out for you, right?",Bs,1
B,I don't even think you've got to connect,Be,2
B,it,S,2
B,"to the wall, do you?",S,3
C,It's just the wireless.,Bs,2
C,"I mean, I think, right now, we have, like, five products we're talking about: a phone,",S,2
C,"a TV,",S,2
B,a computer ,S,2
C,"What's that one in there? B: That's a phone. A: Oh, okay, a phone.",S,2
C,"And they've all got separate software systems, different operating systems.",S,2
C,If you could have this all on one operating system,Be,2
C,that controls,Bs,2
A,all these devices ,S,2
A,Right. So you bring your entertainment all into one,Bs,1
A,system,S,1
C,instead of having everything be separate.,Bs,1
C,So that seems like something that has potential to me.,Bs,1
C,[writing on paper],D,0
C,A single operating system,S,1
C,"to control,",Bs,1
C,"you know, your TV,",S,2
B,"your computer, and ",S,2
C,Phone.,S,2
C,And interface,Bs,2
A,"the phone, right? So basically, the phone as well. Yeah.",S,2
A,"Because if you're saying it's for the family,",R,2
A,"right, us, older members of the family,",S,2
A,we're more entertained by watching,Bs,2
A,movies,S,2
A,or sports,S,2
C,"or whatever we've grown up doing, right? We want that.",Be,2
A,TV programs.,S,2
A,Yeah. Our kids,S,2
B,are maybe more interested in social media.,S,2
A,"They still like doing those kind of things, but they're more interested in spending a certain amount of their time getting likes out there somewhere. So I think this concept of bringing everything together, that works.",Bs,1
B,But would you want to do it like a console? Is it a ,S,1
B,But can this be mobile,F,1
B, or is it just for home use?,Be,1
A,"Is that all it is, a home-use entertainment system?",S,1
B,"I don't know. I mean, it could be, because it's our product.",S,1
A,So we can either call it a home entertainment system/personal assistant.,R,1
B,"Entertainment nowadays, though, has got to be mobile.",Be,1
C,"But if you're trying to create something that's mobile and entertainment, you've got to compete with this.",F,1
A,"And that's part of the system, I think. In five years ",S,1
A,"To me, that's a difficult theme,",Bs,2
A," because if you're going to add to this, is someone going to carry something",S,2
A,along with their phone?,S,2
C,I don't think so.,Bs,2
C,"Well, what's the thing my phone that I hate right now",Bs,2
C,is it's not a computer.,S,2
C," And so when I go home and I want to do certain things,",Be,2
C,"I'm like, ""I'm not using my phone.",S,2
C,"That thing's terrible to type on and interface with.""",Bs,2
A,It's for on the go.,Bs,2
B,"I get that. What I'm saying is if we want it to be an assistant away from home, right ",Be,1
A,In a vehicle.,S,2
A,"We try to go away from home, I don't know that we you're not going to compete",Bs,2
B,with the phone.,S,2
A,You need another device.,S,1
A,What can you invent and develop that people,S,1
A,are going to carry with them,Be,1
A,in addition to their phone?,S,2
B,"Virtually nothing, unless it's really cool.",Bs,1
B,"Or it's something small,",S,1
B,"like, that would plug into",S,3
B,"the serial port to the computer,",S,3
B,like they have with the troubleshooting manuals,S,3
B,they have out now that pull the codes,Bs,3
B,from the car.,S,2
B,If you had one of those,S,2
B,in a kit,S,2
B,"and it plugged into it,",S,2
B,then it would run,Bs,2
B,"through the car's navigation system, possibly.",S,2
B,Entertainment.,R,1
B,It has to be something,S,1
B,you don't carry.,Be,1
B,"You plug something in,",S,2
B,"you leave it there all the time,",Be,2
A,and it communicates.,Bs,2
A,"If you could go big time on this, right, if you could get a large enough audience",Be,0
A,"or the right company to work with,",Be,0
A,you could come up with something,S,1
A,"that's like what you said, Jeff, that your phone",S,2
A,would communicate,Bs,2
A,with your home.,S,2
C,You could get the phone providers.,S,2
A,"It's an integral part, yeah.",Bs,2
A,"You could create an app, right?",S,2
A,Throw an app out there that would let you communicate,Bs,2
A,with your home,S,2
A,#NAME?,R,1
C,"And then you could possibly  I mean, if you were not subject to all of the individual apps and their designers' whims or whatever  A: And the licenses.",Be,2
A,"Well, this is our concept. So we have our own phone.",S,1
A,"Well, that's what I mean, is if you could communicate,",Be,2
A,just put an app out there,S,2
A,so your phone,S,2
A,would link up,S,2
A,to your system,S,1
C,"and anything you wanted it do, right?",Be,2
A,But we could mirror what it looks like on all these things so that it looks the same.,S,2
A,"Yeah. So like, for instance, now, I can get on the Dish Network app",S,2
A,and I can tell my DVR,S,3
A,to record.,Bs,3
A,I can watch stuff that's on my DVR.,Bs,2
A,So I can kind of interface,Bs,2
A,"with that DVR, right?",S,3
A,So if we created an entertainment system,R,1
A,at home,S,2
A,that did all these cool things,Be,1
A,and released an app out there,S,2
A,that a user,S,2
A,could go into his app and tell his entertainment system,S,2
A,at home,S,2
A,to start doing all these things.,Be,2
A,"You're saying to use your current phone, yeah. That would be ",S,2
B,Mobile part,S,2
A,in the vehicle.,S,2
B,"For the personal assistant mobile part, right?",R,2
C,"But then you're stuck with, you know, how phones",S,2
A,"currently operate, so.",Bs,2
A,Yeah. I just think you're going to have a hard time inventing ,Bs,1
A,something or creating something  ,S,1
A,that people are going to be willing to take with them.,Be,1
A,You might be able to get them to put,Be,2
A,a unit,S,2
A,in their vehicle.,S,2
C,"They're not going to carry it around, though.",Bs,2
B,"They could still because now, I mean, really, if there's an app",S,2
B,"and you get it on your phone,",S,2
B,you still should be able to link that,Be,2
B,right to your navigation screen,S,3
B,on your phone.,S,2
B,"Because that already happens wirelessly,",Bs,2
B,so you'd have that app.,S,2
B,"You'd already have that ability, or you should, to connect",Bs,2
B,from your phone to your,S,2
B,#NAME?,Bs,2
B,You plug it in,S,3
B,"and it senses your signal,",Bs,3
B,it uploads,Bs,3
B,your whole address book.,S,3
B,"Well, this would do the same thing. It could load",Bs,2
B,everything,S,2
B,right into your car.,S,2
B,The entertainment portion,R,1
B,for the kids,S,2
B,in the back.,S,2
B,Even in the front.,S,2
B,If you want to watch,Be,2
B,a game,S,2
B,"or listen to, you know,",Be,2
A,"on the screen in front, something like that.",S,3
A,So here's an idea. I was talking earlier about having like a screen,S,3
A,or a console,S,2
A,or something,S,2
A,"that you can sit in, use this.",Be,2
A,And what if you took the virtual reality and interacted it with whatever.,Be,2
A,"Like smart TVs are out there, right?",S,2
A,You connect your system,S,1
A,"to whatever smart TV you have,",S,2
B,and then there's like a virtual reality where you could You don't even have to have a ,Bs,2
A,Keyboard?,S,3
A,"a unique screen, like a touchscreen or something like that.",S,3
A,You could train the virtual reality to say,Be,2
A,#NAME?,Bs,3
A,in the screen.,S,3
A,And then you'd be like that kid on the commercials,S,2
A,"who's waving his hands around, you know?",Bs,2
A,"In your virtual reality, it would sense where you're going on",Bs,2
A,"that screen,",S,3
A,clicking here.,S,3
A,Maybe you could have a virtual typewriter,S,3
A,or a keyboard,S,3
A,to be able to do all those things.,Be,3
A,"You know, and if you could somehow interface with",Be,2
A,#NAME?,Bs,3
B,"where you just put the phone in, right?",S,2
A,Put the phone on it.,S,2
A,But maybe you would just have them put,Be,3
C,their own goggles or glasses on. I don't know.,S,3
C,"For interfacing, then, you would need a camera",S,3
C,"to watch the person, right,",Be,3
A,and take that input.,Bs,2
C,"Yeah, or a glove or something.",S,3
A,"But it would need to know spatial, you know, need to know where you're moving, right?",Be,2
A,"Yeah. You'd have to set up some kind of a reference, maybe, to  B: Exactly. Some sort of datum, right? Okay. So what have we got?",Be,2
C,"We've got to draw something. [reading documents] So what the system would be,",S,1
C,"so we need to define that, how it works ",Be,1
B,and interacts with people.,S,1
C,What the personal assistant entertainment system,R,1
B,would provide.,Be,1
C,"We don't have to do any manufacturing, production, market launch, just the concept design. That's it, huh?",R,0
B,"So we can answer these three. We've already discussed what it should be or what we want it to be, right, for entertainment. But we need to further ",R,1
B,How it works,Bs,1
A,and interacts.,Bs,1
A,"I think all these ideas that we said, you know, music, video, gaming, reading, social media, these are all currently provided within",Bs,2
A,"our PCs,",S,2
A,"laptops,",S,2
A,"tablets,",S,2
A,or televisions,S,2
B,"at home right now, right?",S,2
A,So maybe what this could be would be a system,S,1
A,"that you would walk in,",Be,2
A,you'd plug it,Bs,2
A,into the wall,S,3
A,"to pick up the internet,",S,2
A,"and you would just tell it what's your phone,",S,2
A,"what's your TV,",S,2
A,what all your systems are.,S,2
A,find a way to have the entertainment system,S,1
A,bring all that together.,Be,1
A,And then you wouldn't have to be an IT guy to figure out how to put it all,S,2
A,on the network,S,2
A,and make it all talk,Be,2
A,to each other,S,2
A,if you could up with a system,S,1
A,that would talk to,Be,1
A,all those things,S,2
B,and integrate them all together.,Bs,1
B,"Yeah, you would just list them. It would ask what they are, you'd list them, and it would know how to communicate",Bs,2
B,to an Android,S,2
B,versus an Apple.,S,2
B,It would have the technology,S,2
B,to communicate to it.,Bs,2
B,"I mean, set it up one time",Be,2
B,"and be done, right?",Bs,2
B,And maybe it's set up so if your kids,S,2
B,have an Android,S,2
B,and you have an Apple,S,2
B," how many times does that happen? Maybe when you log in, you say,",Be,2
B,"""Okay, this is Sue,"" you know?",Bs,2
B,And one of the kids,S,2
B,"logs in,",Bs,2
B,"you know, ""Who is it?"" ""Sue.""",Bs,2
B,So it knows the hookup,S,2
B,"to their phone,",S,2
B,and they have an Android,S,2
A,or whatever.,S,2
A,"Because it does say, [reading documents] ""How does it interact with people?"" That was the second bullet, ""How does it interact with people?"" It has to identify.",R,1
B,"[taking picture on the phone] Okay, so let's start drawing up. I'm assuming they want some kind of a drawing or something to kind of ",D,0
B,Maybe a flowchart.,D,0
C,Start with a big TV screen.,S,3
A,"[writing on board] We have to have some kind of a console, right?",S,3
B, I'm picturing something the size of a gaming system.,S,2
A,"Like a receiver or something, you mean?",S,3
A,"Yeah, something like, you know, the Xbox",S,3
A,or something like that. Just something,S,3
A,that's going to take up the space,Bs,3
A,of an Xbox.,S,3
A,"It's going to have a little platform or whatever,",S,3
C,"you put it in the corner, right, and it ",S,3
C,Yep. It's going to be connected,S,2
A,to your home network.,S,2
B,"Connected into the internet, right?",S,2
C,"You see, that, to me, would be optional.",Bs,2
B,"Well, you're saying wireless or whatever, right?",S,2
B,"Yeah. Because like, for example, in my home right now,",S,2
B,"because of the location of it, you know, if it wasn't for wireless,",Be,2
B,I'd be in a lot of trouble,Bs,2
A,because I couldn't have a wired cable there.,S,3
A,"Well, but what I'm saying is I guess what I'm doing is I'm eliminating the router.",S,3
A," Right now, a lot of people",S,2
A,have the router,S,3
A,and a wireless network,S,2
A,to run,Bs,2
A,"at home, right?",S,2
C,You're going to need to kind of circumvent that.,Be,2
A,You'd have to convert the internet service provider.,S,2
A,"Right now, I think there's a certain amount of challenge",Bs,2
A,with having to put everything,S,2
A,"on the server,",S,2
A,then connecting it,S,2
C,"all to your home network, right?",S,2
C,I don't follow. I think your device,S,2
C,has to connect,S,2
C,to your home network.,S,2
C,"I mean, you have internet",S,2
C,"coming into your home,",S,2
C,you have to have a router.,S,3
A,"That has to be there. Unless this is a router, too.",S,3
A,So what you're saying is this,S,3
A,acts as a router.,Bs,3
A,This kind of takes the place of your home network.,S,2
A,It's almost like a home network that's going to make it easy for you to integrate,Bs,2
B,everything.,S,2
B,"So, yeah. Because I'm with Jeff. I think you'd leave out whether it's a router.",S,3
B,"Because sometimes, with the cable,",S,3
B,you need a router,S,3
B,and a modem,S,3
B,", whereas I have a satellite,",S,3
C,I just have a router.,S,3
B,"So that way, it meets cable,",S,2
B,"it meets people that have dishes, like I have.",S,2
A,You don't need a modem.,S,3
A,"Okay, so you guys are  To me, I was thinking that this",S,2
A,could take the place of all that.,Bs,2
A,You just plug it in,S,2
A,and eliminate that complication.,Bs,2
A,"But you could say, just plug this into",S,2
A,the wall,S,3
A,"and tell it what that information is,",Be,2
C,and then it just takes that signal.,Bs,3
B,"It just connects to it, yeah. This, I like.",Bs,2
B,That could be like an improvement,Bs,1
C,on the next version of the product.,S,1
C,Okay. All right. So how does this connect?,S,2
C,"This is our box,",S,2
C,and now we want this to be our entertainment system.,R,1
A,[writing on board],D,0
A,Got your on/off button,S,3
A,there.,S,3
B,"And I guess it's going to have to have a screen, right?",S,3
B,"Yeah, but would the screen",S,3
B,be on that box,S,2
A,or would it be separately in the room somewhere else?,S,2
C,"No, I think it would be a movable screen.",S,3
A,"Well, it'd just be a TV or a ",S,2
C,You'd just connect it.,S,2
A,You don't need a screen.,S,3
C,"Yeah, I'm thinking a TV screen.",S,3
C,You don't need to sell any screen with it.,Be,3
C,You just connect it,S,2
C,to your computer screen,S,3
B,or A/V or whatever.,S,3
B,"See, I would draw a big TV screen right here",S,3
B,because that's your main everything's,S,1
A,"running off of, right?",Bs,1
C,[writing on board],D,0
C,"Yeah. Entertainment at home,",Bs,1
B,you're going to have a TV.,S,2
C,"Yep. We're not supplying that, that's already there.",S,2
B,So this is your customer.,S,2
B,Or we only have like a 30-inch TV.,S,3
C,"That's all I got. So, unlike your 70-inch.",S,3
A,"So its features,",S,2
A, it's going to have software.,S,3
C,[writing on board],D,0
B,And that software's primary function is to connect.,Bs,2
C,Devices.,S,2
B,"I mean, we could put a phone",S,2
B,just as another device,S,2
B,right here.,S,2
C,"So let's make a list. Like, so for example, I have an Xbox. Put the Xbox.",S,2
C,"That's got to be able to be, you know, connected.",S,2
C,"Or I have four PCs,",S,2
C,"you know, in my home, a couple laptops,",S,2
B,a couple desktops.,S,2
A,"Yeah, you can make your own network.",Be,2
A,So all the entertainment devices,S,2
A,in the home.,S,2
C,Let's just list a few. It's going to be your cable.,S,2
A,Xbox.,S,2
C,Your gaming. Gaming system.,S,2
A,Phones.,S,2
C,Your computer.,S,2
B,"Laptops,",S,2
B,phones.,S,2
A,"And one thing we haven't talked about is printers, too. You can do printers, connect it to the printer.",F,2
B,"That's not entertainment, John.",R,1
C,I know. It's part of a personal assistant.,R,1
B,"That's where I was going at. So if he's to do one of these reports and go, ""Hey, where's the directions,""",Bs,2
B,it,S,1
C,prints it out for you.,Bs,2
C,"Okay, and then it's going to be a virtual reality. ",Be,2
C, [writing on board] And what that's going to do is ,D,0
B,"You're going to have virtual reality experiences, right?",Be,2
B,Are we supplying like a virtual reality headset,S,3
B,or are we just going to do software,S,3
A,to communicate to it to say ,Bs,2
A,Anybody can have whatever they have. It would work.,Bs,2
C,[writing on board],D,0
C,"Right now, it would have to be something physical",S,3
A,"you'd put in front of your eyes, right?",S,3
A,"Yeah, and it's going to we don't have time to flesh that out, but it's going to be something that each member of the family",S,2
B,"can use, right?",Bs,2
B,Because really what our product,S,1
B,is is the technology in this right here.,S,1
B,It's not the devices in my home.,S,2
A,"It's just the technology to communicate, right?",Bs,1
A,"You know, I'm not sure about this because one aspect was use virtual reality, use your",Bs,2
A," Instead of having a headset,",S,3
A,you use your computer screen.,S,3
A,So maybe that's optional.,Bs,3
A,"VR, virtual reality interface",S,2
B,with TV.,S,2
C,"So we've covered how it interacts with people and how the system works, what the personal assistant and entertainment would provide. That's kind of what you're listing over there.",R,1
C,"Well, my thought would be that then, if you're out and about on your phone,",S,2
C,you can connect back,S,2
C,"to this home server,",S,2
C,"if you will, and it would turn on",Bs,2
C,"your Xbox,",S,2
C,"for example, and you could play that right through",Be,2
C,your phone.,S,2
C,It could relay,Be,2
C,that screen image,S,3
C,"that would've just been relayed to your TV,",S,2
B,"but instead of your TV, now it's relayed to your phone screen.",S,2
B,To your phone.,S,2
B,"So it's working two ways, back and forth,",Bs,2
B,"when you're gone, using your",Be,2
B,phone,S,2
C,in the car.,S,2
A,Or a computer screen.,S,3
C,So we're saying there's some kind of a router or something to ,S,3
C,"This would be like a server,",S,2
C,"in a way, that's controlling",Bs,2
C,all of your devices,S,2
C,and relaying,Bs,2
C,that information out,S,2
C,if you're on the go,Be,2
C,or just relaying it,Be,2
C,to a different screen,S,3
A,"in your house, you know?",S,2
C,[writing on board],D,0
C,Maybe I've got seven screens,S,3
C,"in my house,",S,2
C,"you know, and I don't want to connect",Be,2
C,them physically.,S,2
C,"Yeah. So this becomes the controlling server,",S,2
C,but yet it has to have the ability to be able to turn on,Be,3
C,or turn off,Be,3
C,"a device,",S,2
C,load it up.,Be,3
C,"You know, maybe the games, if you could get them all",Be,2
C,"on a system,",S,2
C,then you could pick the game,S,2
A,and not have to physically put a game in and out. You know what I mean?,Be,2
A,Yeah. So that would be what we talked about with some of the software,S,3
A,to connect,Be,2
A,all the entertainment devices.,S,2
A,And there would also have to be [writing on board],D,0
A,some kind of an app,S,2
A,to connect,Be,2
B,the phone.,S,2
B,"Yeah, you'd have to have an app",S,2
B,on your phone,S,2
B,"to connect to it,",Be,2
B,which means you'd have to have a signal.,S,3
B,It only works when you have a signal. So that would work.,Bs,3
C,Personal assistant.,R,1
C,We may need to address that a little bit more. The brains of that could be stored in the software,S,2
A,"on the server, and then ",S,2
A,"Because that's a computer, too.",S,2
A,Yeah. The personal assistant portion of it is making everything that's available,S,1
A,on your home PC,S,2
A,"through this server,",S,2
A,communicating,Bs,2
C,with your phone.,S,2
B,It's a software.,S,2
C,It's simplifying everything.,Bs,2
C,Right. It's giving you access when you're on mobile to access that stream.,Bs,2
A,"Let's just write that. Let's, like, write ""personal assistant is like a software bundle.""",Bs,1
C,"[writing on board] Yeah, software ability to take on the go.",D,0
B,It's a server,S,2
A,plus the app.,S,2
A,So if I said personal assistant,R,1
B,ties phone ,S,2
A,To a server.,S,2
B,To home.,S,2
C,"To home equipment, to our ",S,2
B,"Equipment, yeah. And really, you would start at a very basic of that, which would be telling it, ""Hey, connect to computer such and such,"" ""Do this,"" or ""Connect to Xbox,"" or ""Do this,"" ""Connect to my Dish Network and show me World Fishing Network.""",Be,2
B,"On the go, got to have it.",Bs,2
A,Then maybe the next level will be setting it up to my fish finder.,Be,2
A,It's the convenience. People like convenience.,Bs,1
A,Instead of being subject,Be,2
A,to Dish Network's app,S,2
A,"to watch your TV,",S,2
A,you use this app to just turn your TV on,Bs,2
A,and see what's on it.,Bs,2
A,"In addition to that, it can connect",Bs,2
A,"you to your home PC,",S,2
A,"your doorbell camera, anything.",S,3
C,That's all linked into this server. And this is ,S,2
C,That has the ability to connect,Bs,2
C,"all of these personal devices, basically.",S,2
C,"That's what we'd be selling it as, right? And we can take all of our entertainment devices",S,2
C,and connect it,S,2
A,to this.,S,2
C,In an easy fashion that allows you to watch it either,Bs,2
C,anywhere in the house,S,2
A,or out on the go.,Bs,2
B,Anywhere your app,S,2
A,will open up.,Bs,2
C,"And you're going to want it kind of like Apple's constantly updating their software, right? You're going to have to provide this for it. Every time there's a new ",Be,2
B,That's the downside to this system.,Bs,1
C,If you had a system,S,1
C,"that you provided everything,",Be,1
B,"then, you know, you control it, right?",Bs,1
A,"So that's the hard business decision there, is what do you do.",Bs,1
C,"No, no. I think, realistically, people have a lot of different devices,",S,2
C,"and it's going to be hard to design something that broad, right?",Bs,1
C,"Realistically, this is what you're dealing with, right? People",S,2
C,coming in with their phones,S,2
C,or other devices,S,2
C,and other gaming systems.,S,2
A,"You can't do it all, right? So.",Bs,1
A,You're going to have to probably provide some kind of a Bluetooth device,S,2
C,"or something that will communicate with all the different languages used, right?",Bs,2
B,Or maybe you can just use Bluetooth.,S,3
C,"And then the only other things that I think, like you said, the VR thing",S,2
C,"would be cool at some point,",Bs,2
C,if you could improve that interface at some point,Be,2
C,and you could actually have a keyboard,S,3
C,"and type in space,",Be,3
B,"you know, that kind of thing, at some point, that would be cool.",Bs,2
A,"Yeah. So that'd be the improvement down the road, the next version, the next upgrade.",Bs,1
B,[writing on board],D,0
C,"You're in the car,",S,2
C,I'm connected,Be,2
C,"to my home computer,",S,2
B,and then I had a VR keyboard or something like that.,S,3
C,As long as you weren't driving.,Be,2
B,This would go good,Bs,2
C,with the autonomous driving vehicles in the future.,F,2
B,"Because then you're not driving anymore,",Be,2
B,"where you're just sitting in virtual reality,",Bs,2
B,"going like this, doing your finances",Bs,2
B,"in the car,",S,2
C,"because the car is driving itself, so.",Bs,2
A,Spending all the money you don't have.,Bs,0
A,But the idea here is the virtual reality kind of a glove,S,3
A,where you can use,Be,3
A,the screen,S,3
A,on your TV,S,2
C,like your phone.,S,2
B,Or just use eye input. It's watching your eyes. All right. What are we missing?,F,2
A,Okay. So what we're going do is we're going to invent basically a server,S,1
A,that's plug-and-play.,Bs,1
A,The customer,S,2
A,"takes it home,",Bs,2
A,"boots it up,",Bs,2
A,and starts inputting,Bs,2
A,all the different devices,S,2
A,"in their home, names and models of all those devices.",S,2
A,"And then we, as a company,",S,2
A,will provide the software,S,2
A,that allows them to just go and pick things.,Bs,2
A,They don't have to create passwords and know what frequencies and everything.,Bs,3
A,Everything is on.,Bs,1
A, The server's,S,2
A,going to use,Bs,2
A,the customer's TV,S,2
A,"and stereo equipment,",S,2
A,"probably, existing in the home.",S,2
A,It's going to interface with all of that.,Bs,2
A,I guess we assume it's smart technology on most things,Bs,2
A,or maybe you could provide little pucks,S,3
A,to connect,S,2
A,all those things,S,2
A,to this system.,S,1
A, And then we want to use a virtual reality interface,S,2
A,either through gloves,S,3
A,or goggles,S,3
A,to basically make your TV,S,2
A,work like,Bs,2
A,your phone would.,S,2
A,So anything that you would want to do,Be,2
A,"on the phone,",S,2
A,"instead of having to use that small screen,",S,3
A,you're now going to use,Be,1
A,this entertainment system.,S,1
A,We're not necessarily going to make you have to buy,Bs,2
A,a brand-new TV to do that.,S,2
A,"Hopefully, with the virtual reality, we can figure out how to make that work",Bs,2
A,with your existing TV.,S,2
A," And so the software,",S,2
A,the main idea behind this is to connect all of your,Bs,2
A,entertainment,S,2
A,and information devices together.,S,2
A,"Your TV,",S,2
A,"your gaming,",Be,2
B,your computers.,S,2
A,Printers.,S,2
A,Printers. Anything that you would do,Be,2
A,on your computer,S,2
A,to make that mobile.,Be,2
A,And then do that through an app,S,2
A,on your phone.,S,2
A,So the personal assistant,R,1
A,"part of this is that, while you're on the go,",Be,2
A,you can completely connect back to home.,Bs,2
A,"And anything that you could do for entertainment at home,",Be,2
A,you can do through,Bs,2
A,your phone,S,2
B,on that app.,S,2
B,"Yeah, I think one word that sums that up is going to be ""convenience,""",Bs,1
B,"because everybody's on the go, you know.",Be,2
B,"So being in the car,",S,2
B,"mobile,",S,2
B,"that's the personal assistant to me,",R,1
A,"is the convenience that it gives you, ",Bs,1
A,and that tie at home.,Bs,1
A,"So maybe this is the hallmark of the personal assistant, is it",S,1
A,allows you access to your home system,Bs,2
A,while you're mobile.,Be,2
